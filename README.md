## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out the job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### Continued development

I chose to work on this project because I believe it is perfect for solidifying my React skills. Though I've only used some basic knowledge of React, practices like this help to build a solid fundamental for my future development in React. On the other hand, since I have chosen to store filters in an object variable, it unintentionally allows me to have a better understanding of and become more comfortable working with objects. I plan on doing several more projects using React before learning more advanced React knowledge.
